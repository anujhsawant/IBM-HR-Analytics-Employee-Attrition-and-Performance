# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-and-Performance

Human Resource analytics (HR Analytics) is defined as the area in the field of analytics that deals with people analysis and applying analytical process to the human capital within the organization to improve employee performance and employee retention.
Most organizations already have data that is routinely collected; however, the HR department cannot simply look at the collected data in a table and gain insights from it. Raw data on its own cannot actually provide any useful insight. It would be like looking at a large spreadsheet full of numbers and words. Once organized, compared and analyzed, this raw data provides useful insight. They can help answer questions like:
• What patterns can be revealed in employee turnover?
• How long does it take to hire employees?
• What amount of investment is needed to get employees up to a fully productive
speed?
• Which of our employees are most likely to leave within the year?
The agenda of this project is to answer the most important question from above which is ‘What makes employees resign?’ or ‘Which employees are most likely to leave within a year based on various information about them?’
As we all know the resources required to replace an employee after he/she resigns are tremendous and they not just cost money but also costs significant amount of time to the company. Thus, if the HR department was able to find the employees who are likely to resign, the company would be able to retain them by taking some measures.
